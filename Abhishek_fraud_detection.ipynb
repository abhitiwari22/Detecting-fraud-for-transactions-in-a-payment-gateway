    "Detecting fraud for transactions in a payment gateway\n",
    "A new disruptive payment gateway start-up, ‘IndAvenue’, has started gaining traction\n",
    "due to its extremely low processing fees for handling online vendors’ digital payments.\n",
    "This strategy has led to very low costs of acquiring new vendors.\n",
    "Unfortunately, due to the cheap processing fees, the company was not able to build and deploy a robust\n",
    "and fast fraud detection system.Consequently, a lot of the vendorshave accumulated significant\n",
    "economic burden due to handling   fraudulent transactions on theirplatforms. \n",
    "\n",
    "This has resulted in a significant number of current clients leaving IndAvenue’s payment gateway platform\n",
    "for more expensive yet reliable payment gateway companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The company’s data engineers curated a dataset that they believe follows the real\n",
    "world distribution of transactions on their payment gateway. The company hired Insofe and provided \n",
    "it with the dataset, to create a fast and robust AI based model that\n",
    "can detect and prevent fraudulent transactions on its payment gateway.\n",
    "\n",
    "They have provided you with the dataset that has the `is_fraud` column, which  \n",
    "encodes the information whether a transaction was fraudulent or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this hackathon, you will now have to use this curated data to create a machine\n",
    "learning model that will be able to predict the `is_fraud` column"
